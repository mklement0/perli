  WARNING:
    `rlwrap` not found: keyboard support for command-line editing,
    command history, and tab-completion will not be available.
    Install rlwrap as follows:
     - OSX, via Homebrew (http://brew.sh):
         brew install rlwrap
     - Debian-based Linux distros such as Ubuntu:
         sudo apt-get install rlwrap
     - Fedora:
         sudo yum install rlwrap
     - Cygwin (Windows):
         Re-run Cygwin's setup*.exe and install
         Utils > rlwrap and Base > libreadline*.
     - MSYS / MinGW / Git Bash (Windows):
         Sadly, rlwrap is not offered. The next best thing is to use a
         native Windows Perl, with which you get at least basic command-line
         editing and in-session history support:
         Deactivate the Unix Perl with \`mv /bin/perl /bin/perl.inactive\`
         and install Strawberry Perl: http://strawberryperl.com/
     - All others:

  - Type a single-line expression or statement(s); each line is its own scope.
  - Use `$var = ...;`, not `my $var = ...;` for variables that should
    live on after the line they're defined on (global variables).
  - Results are automatically printed; if the result is a hash or array, and
    you want to see it as such, assign to a variable and output with `\`; e.g.
        %ht = (key1 => 'val1', key2 => 'val2'); \%ht;   
  - Use `.remi ... =~ ...` to print additional regex-matching details:
    Also prints $` ($PREMATCH), $& ($MATCH), $' ($POSTMATCH),
    %- (%LAST_MATCH_START), @- (@LAST_MATCH_START), @+ (@LAST_MATCH_END); e.g.:
        .remi "a barn." =~ /(?<foo>b(.)(.))n/
  - To load modules or activate pragmas, use -M options on startup; e.g.:
        perli -MString::Util=trim  
    alternatively, load modules from inside the REPL; e.g.:
        use String::Util qw(trim); trim ' a   b  '
    or preload them in initialization file ~/.perli_rc.
    Note: pragmas only take global effect as startup argument -M<pragma>
  REPL commands (start with '.'):
    .doc <search-string> or ? <search-string> or ... <search-string>? searches
      the Perl docs.
    .remi <regex-op> prints additional RegEx Matching Info; see above.
    .sh <shell-cmd> executes a shell command using system(), with arguments
      interpreted by the shell only; e.g.: .sh ls
    .clear / .cls clears the screen; note: may not work in Cygwin and MSYS.
    .exit / .quit exits the REPL (just 'exit' works too).
    .man opens perli's own man page.
    .home opens perli's homepage, {{homeUrl}}.
    .help or ? prints these instructions.

#  - Do not alter the `__DATA__` line in any way.
#  - The entire rest of this script

#  - The document must be formatted to look good in all 3 viewing scenarios:
#     - as a man page, after conversion to ROFF with marked-man
#     - as plain text (raw Markdown source)
#     - as HTML (rendered Markdown)
#  Markdown formatting guidelines:
#   - GENERAL
#     To support plain-text rendering in the terminal, limit all lines to 80 chars.,
#     and, for similar rendering as HTML, *end every line with 2 trailing spaces*.
#   - HEADINGS
#     - For better plain-text rendering, leave an empty line after a heading
#       marked-man will remove it from the ROFF version.
#     - The first heading must be a level-1 heading containing the utility
#       name and very brief description; append the manual-section number 
#       directly to the CLI name; e.g.:
#         # foo(1) - does bar
#     - The 2nd, level-2 heading must be '## SYNOPSIS' and the chapter's body
#       must render reasonably as plain text, because it is printed to stdout
#       when  `-h`, `--help` is specified:
#         Use 4-space indentation without markup for both the syntax line and the
#         block of brief option descriptions; represent option-arguments and operands
#         in angle brackets; e.g., '<foo>'
#     - All other headings should be level-2 headings in ALL-CAPS.
#   - TEXT
#      - Use NO indentation for regular chapter text; if you do, it will 
#        be indented further than list items.
#      - Use 4-space indentation, as usual, for code blocks.
#      - Markup character-styling markup translates to ROFF rendering as follows:
#         `...` and **...** render as bolded (red) text
#         _..._ and *...* render as word-individually underlined text
#   - LISTS
#      - Indent list items by 2 spaces for better plain-text viewing, but note
#        that the ROFF generated by marked-man still renders them unindented.
#      - End every list item (bullet point) itself with 2 trailing spaces too so
#        that it renders on its own line.
#      - Avoid associating more than 1 paragraph with a list item, if possible,
#        because it requires the following trick, which hampers plain-text readability:
#        Use '&nbsp;<space><space>' in lieu of an empty line.

__DATA__
# perli(1) - a simple, convenient Perl REPL

## SYNOPSIS

A simple, convenient Perl REPL for interactive experimentation.

    perli [<options>]

    --norc      skips loading of the initialization file

    The following Perl options are also supported:

    -M<name>    (repeatable) load a module and import its defaults,  
                             or activate a pragma (-M-<name> deactivates)
    -m<module>  (repeatable) load a module without importing
    -I<dir>     (repeatable) prepend <dir> to module search path (@INC)

Initialization file is `~/.perli_rc`

Standard options: `--help`, `--man`, `--version`, `--home`

## DESCRIPTION

`perli` is a Perl REPL (read-eval-print loop) for interactive  
experimentation with Perl code, convenient documentation lookups,  
and quick computations.

On Unix-like platforms, installation of `rlwrap` is highly recommended; see
`PLATFORM NOTES` below.

Interactive input is executed line by line, and results are automatically  
printed.

Once you've entered the REPL (invoked `perli`), submit `?` for an  
overview of its features and commands.

An optional initialization file may be maintained at `~/.perli_rc`.

## INITIALIZATION FILE

To preload modules into the REPL, you may maintain an optional  
initialization file with Perl code at `~/.perli_rc`, which is loaded  
automatically on startup.

*Caveat*: The scope of `use <pragma>` statements is limited to the  
initialization file itself;  
if you want a pragma such as `use integer` to be in effect for the REPL,  
you must specify it on the command line with `-M<pragma>`.

The file need not be a module, and nothing needs to be exported;  
simply load modules / declare subroutines for the REPL in the global  
namespace.

The last statement in the file is expected to return a truthy value;  
otherwise, a warning is issued.

## REPL FUNDAMENTALS AND LIMITATIONS

A concise summary of most of the topics discussed below can be displayed from
inside `perli` by submitting `?`.

### Perl features in effect by default

The active locale's **character encoding** is respected (with strings internally
represented as Unicode and automatic translation to and from the locale's 
encoding for streams and files, as if `perl -C` had been run).
Also see `LOCALE SUPPORT` below.

All **optional features** of the host Perl version are enabled (as if `perl -E`
had been run). For instance, the `say` feature is in effect in host Perl
versions >= 5.9.5.  
To deactivate all features, start `perli` with `perli -M-feature=:all`.  
To activate a given version's feature bundle, start `perli` with something like  
`perli -Mv5.10`.

Useful **warnings** are enabled by default (as if `perl -w` had been run).  
To enable ALL warnings, start `perli` with `perli -W`.  
To SUPPRESS all warnings, start `perli` with `perli -X`.

`use English;` is in effect to enable the natural-language aliases for Perl's
special variables; e.g., `$MATCH` for `$&`.

`use Math::Trig;` is in effect to facilitate calculations involving trigonometry
and the constant pi.

### Input

Only *single-line* input is supported, and each line submitted is its own
scope; this has the following implications:

  * Pragmas such as `use locale;` only take effect for the line at hand;  
    for pragmas to take effect globally, you must specify them on the  
    command line when starting `perli`; e.g., `perli -Mlocale`.

  * Variables declared with `my` only exist on the line they're defined on;
    omit the `my` to create global variables, which stay in scope for the  
    remainder of the REPL session.

To complement direct input of Perl code, special REPL commands - commmands
provided by `perli` itself - are availabe, all of which start with `.` and
must be the only statement on the line.
`?` is an alias for `.help` or `.doc`

Submit `?` from inside `perli` to see all REPL commands; only a select few are
highlighted here.

#### Documentation lookups

`perli` supports Perl documentation lookups using either of the following 
two forms:

  * `? [<perldoc-opt>] <search-term>`
  * `... <search-term>?`

The first form is the stand-alone form that also allows explicit passing of
options to `perldoc`.

The second form is handy for quick lookup of a term as you're typing a line of
Perl code.

In the first form without `[<perldoc-opt>]`, and invariably in the second form,
the lookup is "fuzzy" for convenience, i.e., `perli` tries to guess the type of
element being searched for, and automatically passes the appropriate perldoc
option (`-f` for function, ...) behind the scenes. `perli` may try several
options in sequence until a lookup succeeds.

If the lookup ultimately fails, or `perli` guessed the wrong type, use the first
form and pass `perldoc` options explicitly; e.g.: `? -q while` explicitly
searches the FAQs for the word `while` instead of looking up the flow-control
keyword.

As with `perldoc`, topics may be looked up without the `perl` prefix; e.g.,
`? run` is a shortcut for `? perlrun`.

#### Regex-match inspection

`.remi ... =~ ...` facilitates inspection of regular-expression matches by
automatically printing the automatic variables that Perl defines for the most
recent successful match.

Note that only a single expression involving `=~` is supported; e.g.:

    .remi "a barn." =~ /(?<foo>b(.)(.))n/

Following the expression's own result, the values of the following special
variables are printed (`use English;` aliases in parentheses):

    $` ($PREMATCH), $& ($MATCH), $' ($POSTMATCH),
    %- (%LAST_MATCH_START), @- (@LAST_MATCH_START), @+ (@LAST_MATCH_END)

To reduce noise, only non-empty values are printed.

Note that `%-` is only printed if *named* capture groups are present, and that
the related `%+` (`%LAST_PAREN_MATCH`) is never printed, because its information
is effectively contained in the value of `%-`.

As a reminder, a regex operation's result is a Boolean, if the regex contains
no capture groups at all, and the list of capture group values otherwise -
whether from named or unnamed groups.

### Output printing and formatting

Evaluation results are automatically printed, using the core `Data::Dumper`
module, which presents results in a way that allows its reuse as input and
shows the structure of the result.

To best represent arrays and hashes, store them in a variable first and prefix
the variabe with `\` (so as to hand a *reference* to `Data::Dumper`); try
`\%ENV`, for instance.

To print a result as-is instead, use an explicit output command, such as
`print`, `printf` or `say`, but note that the automatic result-printing
mechanism still applies and then appends `1`, which is the return value from
these output statements. Explicit output commands are also needed if locale
support is activated and numbers should be formatted accordingly - see
`LOCALE SUPPORT` below.

Warnings and error messages are printed in different colors so as to stand out.
However, you can disable coloring altogether with the `PERLI_NOCOLOR`
enviroment variable - see `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES` below.

### Tab completion

If `rlwrap` is available (see `PLATFORM NOTES` below), tab-completion
is available, but it lacks context-awareness so that ALL tokens are offered
in any context, which can be confusing.  
For instance, typing `$<tab>` does NOT limit the completion candidates to just
variable names, unfortunately.
(Conceivably, this could be remedied in a future `perli` release, using
`rlwrap`'s custom tab-completion feature.)

The following elements are added to the pool of tab-completion tokens:

* Perl functions, operators, compound statements
* Perl's special variables
* `perli`'s own REPL commands
* any token typed or output during a REPL session

Note: The latter facilitates reusing previously typed tokens such as custom
variables, but, due to indiscriminately adding tokens both from the input and
output of commands, can also introduce noise.

Generally, typing at least a few characters reduces the set of candidates,
and repeatedly pressing the Tab key cycles through them.

### Command history

If `rlwrap` is available (see `PLATFORM NOTES` below), a persistent command
history is maintained in file `~/.perli_history`

## LOCALE SUPPORT

Your system's active locale is only respected in terms of *character
encoding*;
NO other aspects of the locale, notably number formatting, are explicitly
activated, deferring to the host Perl's default behavior.

Perl's default behavior is NOT to support the active locale so as to maintain
backward compatibility.
Locale support - once activated with  `use locale;` - is patchy in older Perl
versions and the behavior changed over time; UTF-8-based locales further
complicate things - see `perldoc perllocale` or visit  
http://perldoc.perl.org/perllocale.html

To activate locale support in `perli`, start with `perli -Mlocale`.

Note, however, that the *automatically* printed numeric results do NOT
reflect Perl's effective LC_NUMERIC locale category; use explicit `print`,
`printf`, or `say` statements instead, but note that the automatic
result-printing mechanism still applies and then appends `1`, which is the
return value from these output statements.

Note that, as of this writing, the MSYS Unix-emulation enviroment for Windows
and products based on it (such as Git Bash) do not support locales at all (the
'C' locale is invariably in effect).

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  * `PERLI_PERLBIN`  
    Allows overriding the `perl` executable that is used to run the REPL.  
    By default, the (first) `perl` executable in the system's path is used.

  * `PERLI_PS1`  
    If specified, overrides the default prompt. Specify the string  
    including a space to put between the prompt proper and the start  
    of the user input, if desired.  
    Note that if you want the prompt to be colored, the value has to  
    include the relevant ANSI color escape sequences. 

  * `PERLI_NOCOLOR`  
    If set to `1`, turns off all colored output.

## PLATFORM NOTES

`perli` requires Perl version v5.6.2 or higher.

On Unix platforms, `perli` makes use of the `rlwrap` utility, if present,  
to provide command-line editing support, persistent command history,  
and simple tab completion.

Installing `rlwrap` is highly recommended, and in its absence a warning  
with download instructions is given.

On Windows, `rlwrap` is not available, unfortunately, but you do get  
in-session history and basic command-line editing out of the box.

## LICENSE

For license information and more, visit the home page by running  
`perli --home`, or, from within the REPL, `.home`.

## STANDARD OPTIONS

All standard options provide information only.

  * `-h, --help`  
    Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick  
    reference.

  * `--man`  
    Displays this manual page, which is a helpful alternative to using  
    `man`, if the manual page isn't installed, such as on Windows.

  * `--version`  
    Prints version information.
    
  * `--home`  
    Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser.
